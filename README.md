Typing speed test

The Typing Speed Test project leverages the Tkinter library in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing typing speed evaluation tool. 
Tkinter, being a widely-used GUI toolkit, provides the foundation for building the user interface components of the application.

In this project, Tkinter is utilized to design an intuitive interface that guides users through the typing test process. 
Users are presented with a text entry field where they can input the provided text. 
Tkinter's event handling mechanisms are employed to capture user keystrokes and calculate typing speed and accuracy.
